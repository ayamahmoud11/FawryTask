DNS Troubleshooting for internal.example.com
1. Verify DNS Resolution
nslookup internal.example.com

2. Compare Your DNS with Google DNS 
nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8

3. Check if the Server is Responding on Port:
curl -I http://10.0.0.5
telnet 10.0.0.5 80

 4. Trace the Path:
tracert internal.example.com


5. Potential Causes for Unreachability:

Cause	How to Verify
DNS Issue	nslookup fails to resolve the domain name
Network Issue	tracert stops before reaching the destination
Server Not Listening on Ports	telnet or curl fails to connect
Firewall Blocking	No response or connection refused
Service Down (but running internally)	Service works internally but is not visible externally
Incorrect IP Configuration	ipconfig shows incorrect or missing IP


6. Proposed Fixes:

Issue	Fix
DNS Not Working	Change DNS manually to 8.8.8.8
Service Not Listening on Port	Start the service or open the port
Firewall Blocking	Adjust firewall settings to allow the port
Service Not Reachable Externally	Ensure service is accessible outside the network
